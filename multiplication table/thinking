The first time I saw this problem, I come up with the for-loop as below:

  for  (int i=1;i<=9;i++){
    for (int j=i;j<=9;j++){
      cout<<i<<"x"<<j<<"="<<i*j;
    }

However I found it seems impossible to convert the cout into multi-columns.
So, it should ratehr be printed by rows.
Then it's not difficult to figure that a*b=c in every row, with the number of clonum added, a gains 1 by 1, and of course b stays.
OK, the final for-loop shall be as follow:

for  (int i=1;i<=9;i++){
    for (int j=1;j<=i;j++){
      cout<<j<<"x"<<i<<"="<<i*j;
    }
    cout<<endl;
